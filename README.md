My name is Shirsendu, and I am an electrical engineer by profession. I have ample experience in PCB design and embedded coding, and I am skilled in visual design, Excel, and project management.

I have a diverse range of interests and expertise, which has allowed me to work on a variety of different projects throughout my career. One of my proudest accomplishments was running my own solar installation startup, where I oversaw all aspects of the business from design and installation to project management and customer service.

Today, I work in the IT department of a school, where I apply my technical skills to manage and support the school's technology infrastructure. I enjoy working in the education sector and find it very rewarding to help students and teachers make the most of the technology available to them.

In addition to my professional work, I also have a passion for creative pursuits. I enjoy photography, graphic design, and other creative outlets, and I find that these hobbies help me stay creative and inspired in my professional work.

I am a detail-oriented and analytical thinker, and I enjoy solving complex problems and finding innovative solutions. I am also a strong communicator and enjoy collaborating with others to achieve shared goals.

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my family and exploring the great outdoors. I love hiking, camping, and traveling to new places, and I find that these experiences help me stay grounded and energized in my professional work.
